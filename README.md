 # Call Recorder

- Please star ‚≠ê mark to this project to support me.

This is a very simple but powerful auto call recording app for android. It supports Android 12 or later also.

## Notice

If you are using call recoder version 2.4 or below and want to use version 2.5 or later
then you should uninstall the installed version completely before installing v2.5 or later
 and also remember to delete this file at this location 
`/etc/permissions/privapp-permissions-com.hiddenpirates.callrecorder.xml`  

## Usage

After Android 9 or greater, it is not possible to record calls 
by using third party apps. So that\'s why you have to manually 
make this app as a system app. To install this app as a system app, 
read the installation instructions carefully.
